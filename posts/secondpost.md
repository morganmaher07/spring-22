## Who am I?
My name is Morgan Maher, and I am a student at Iowa State University. I am majoring in advertising and minoring in event management. During my time at Iowa State, I have been involved in my sorority, Delta Zeta. Additionally, I interned at Flynn Wright during the Summer of 2021. Once I graduate in May, I will be working full-time as a project coordinator at Flynn Wright. Aside from school, I enjoy playing with animals, spending time with my friends and listening to podcasts. I am from a small town in Iowa called Altoona and hope to relocate to downtown Des Moines.
