I have had experience in many different atmospheres that have helped shape me into the employee I am today. I started my working career as a food service employee at the Altoona Aquatics Center. Next, I moved to a beverage cart attendant at a local golf course and even prepared smoothies at Tropical Smoothie. These jobs taught me the importance of relationships, customer service and teamwork. Later on, I worked as a testing proctor for Iowa State University and then as a receptionist. Both experiences challenged my organizational skills and accountability. Today, as an account service intern, I am proud to be known as a hard worker who forms strong relationships, works well in teams, is trustworthy, and always has a positive attitude.
